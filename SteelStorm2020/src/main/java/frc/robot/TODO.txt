TODO:
 ____________________________
|Create Orient to Angle Drive|
- gyro setup + !testing values!
- create simple P controller to control z-axis
-heading delta method
~ long term create PID controlled z-axis
--> new strat: when z-axis is zero, have PID/P controller on so drives straight and when > then 0.1 P/PID is disabled
--> '' could also use above strat when strafing 
 ________________________________________
|Auton based off of Orient to Angle Drive|
 ________________________________
|Throttle Curve For Mecanum Drive|
-simple math?
 __________________
|Vision Recognition|
-relearn grip and contour tracking/mapping
-PID for tracking object based of coordinates of contours


CHECK LIST:
when testing remeber to check System.out prints for gyro value and drivetrain init method
remove gyro.reset() from DriveTrainSubsystem, move to robot init? or begging of auton
setSafetyEnabled() may need to turn off for auton and also for P controller do more research
set ports for d-pad buttons
calibrate gyro?
stop() method in drivetrain

TODO DriveTrainSubsystem:
getDirection(...) when press button sets direction and keeps at that direction until another button is pressed or z-axis is moved

merge mecanumAngleDrive() and getDirection()

new method step: 
1. if zRotation > threshold
 (true) -> got to manual mecanum drive
 (fasle) -> goto 2
2. if any d-pad buttons pressed 
 (true) -> set Direction to sepcifc value
 (false) -> set Direction to last heading
 --> goto 3
3. angle holding (y,x,ouput)

setDirection
-could be escape button to set to actual last heading if using last pressed button
-when zRotation is being used and or after, cancels and goes to actual last heading

AUTON:
add subsystem/command make run on time 
additionaly add ulta-sonic sensor to detect distance then slow and stop
HOWTO:
add autonCommand to robotInit() -- autonomousCommand = new SodaDelivery();

auton for command and subsystem:
make getAngle() to init the angle
then go forward for x time or ultra sonic sensor
when done isFinished() = true --> stop moving go to teleop

ULTRA SONIC SENSOR setup
use pin 3,6,7 coonect to anolog on rio

12-7-19
Before Match Tests:

-gyro calibration 
(may need to warm up) if not use manual drive for auton and driveCommand

-test ball intake motors
 for in (leftTrig) and out (rightTrig) may need to switch sign on motors.set()

 -test pneumatics (set reg psi 30)
 B-button out, A-button in
 check for leaks

 -test and setup shuffleboard
 camera and gyro

---To Make-----------------

- connect redlines to motor controllers and tie down wire in workable way

-flip redlines and re-drill pneumatic mounts

-add more camber (washer) to sliders (one more on left than right)

-back bumpers

-camera mounts

-backboard drill slots out for pneumatics and rsl light
